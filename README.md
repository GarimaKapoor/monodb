Welcome to MonoDB project

===========

**MonoDB is a light-weight link-based NoSQL database solution. It is fast and scalable, designed to handle big data in distributed computing environment. The link data model is not new in database world, yet MonoDB shows simplified data model per se. For example, traditional RDBMS implements link with JOIN operation, but the cost of the operation is quite expensive and way much harder to make it scalable. On the other hand, MonoDB project aims to offer the real link operation among data records which is able to scale up. This is a hybrid of RDBMS and ColumnFamily data model. This project is originated from legacy project Cloudbean.

## Why MonoDB?

MonoDB enables data to link to other without extra cost. And it's possible to link to data possessed by other data service provider. For instance, record x in service A and record y in service B could be linked to each other so that they can access the connected data on the other side. Or the service provider can control the accessibility of data protecting it from being exploited or breached. The bottom line is that it offers the external scalability among the services using MonoDB, easily making open API to others.
